# What color choices did you make and why?

I selected soft pinks and pastel tones to reflect a playful yet professional aesthetic. These colors align with my personal style while maintaining clarity and readability throughout the homepage.

# How did you apply accessibility and fixes?

To improve accessibility, I increased the font sizes, used high-contrast text, and placed content inside light-colored panels to ensure readability against the background. I also organized the layout into clear sections to help users navigate easily.

# What challenges did you face?

One of the main challenges was balancing creativity with readability. I wanted the design to be colorful without becoming overwhelming. I also had difficulty figuring out how to properly upload files and display the screenshot in the README, but I was able to solve it by following each step carefully.
